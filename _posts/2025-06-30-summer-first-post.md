I can't lie, this summer has been *pretty boring*. Usually, I feel somewhat productive during these times of the year, but with all the important milestones coming up next year, I'm feeling a bit overwhelemed, leading me to do stuff like making this blog. That is okay though, I believe that it is okay to relax during the summer (especially while being campless). Anyways, I've been having a lot of time to do a lot of math and stuff, so be sure to tune in on future posts. I'm probably going to either do one of two things:

1. post solutions to problems I thought were cool (to any subject)
2. or just thought dump.

I'm thinking about posting solutions to Artin's Algebra, as I'm really making the push to getting at the level that I need to be for the upcoming MIT PRIMES cycle, and so I need to develop my higher math skills. I've also been doing some OTIS as well, and if I feel like it I will post some cool problems from that as well.

On a more fun note, I've been playing outside with my parents a lot, and it's really fun; usually we just play badminton and throw around a frisbee. I also signed up for summer gym to get a free for next year, which is suprisingly pretty fun, and it keeps my sleep schedule in line!
